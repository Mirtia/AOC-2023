# Learning C++

This file contains a lot of info that can be found on documentation sources, nothing groundbreaking. The reason I do C++ in Advent is because I think that is a very hard language to master.
I have to go through a lot of new syntactic sugar and also refresh any knowledge that I may have.

And also big props to this guy, [C++ Weekly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpqwCDSfgz0).

And also this thing that is useful for understanding concepts
[C++ Compiler](https://godbolt.org/).

## Concepts

### [[nodiscard]]

This fancy thingy causes the compiler to throw a warning that the value returned from the specific function is not used.

### constexpr 

Evaluate values at compile time.

### std::views

### std::ranges

### lambdas

I really like λambdas 🤓. This is not exactly a new feature of C++ but I'll be using it a lot on this repo.

### noexcept

*''The noexcept operator performs a compile-time check that returns true if an expression is declared to not throw any exceptions.''* OK! Good to know, next.

### std::initializer_list

An object of type ```std::initializer_list<T>``` is a lightweight proxy object that provides access to an array of objects of type const T.

### Reference declaration (&& and &)
